# Apollo AWS AppSync with IAM

Simple check on accessing AWS Appsync schema with AWS IAM through apollo (<https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/graphqlapi/authz/q/platform/js#using-amplify-graphql-client>).

Download the javascript config from AWS AppSync (aws-exports.js) and add user and password that should look like that:

```json
// WARNING: DO NOT EDIT. This file is automatically generated by AWS Amplify. It will be overwritten.

const awsmobile =  {
    "aws_appsync_graphqlEndpoint": "https://xxxxxx.appsync-api.xxxx.amazonaws.com/graphql",
    "aws_appsync_region": "xxx",
    "aws_appsync_authenticationType": "AWS_IAM",
    "accessKeyId": "xxxx",
    "secretAccessKey": "xxxxxx",
};

export default awsmobile;
```

Then you can simply run this:

```bash
./install.sh
yarn start
```
